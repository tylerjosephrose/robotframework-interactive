# robotframework-interactive
This project is designed to allow Robot Framework (RF) commands to be ran interactively from the command line. It is 
important to note that not all RF keywords and commands will work as this is reading the input string and determining 
what to run.

## Installation
`pip install robotframework-interactive` (eventually)

## Limitations
* On Linux Clients the autocomplete feature does not work
* Multiline commands do not work (FOR loops, IF statements, etc)
